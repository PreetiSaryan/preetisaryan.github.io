          <p> I am graduate student at the 
          <a href="https://iiserb.ac.in/department.php?page=Biological%20Sciences&pid=42&id=43">
          Department of Biological Sciences, at IISER Bhopal</a>. I am currently working with 
          <a href="https://iiserb.ac.in/profile.php?empid=MjAx&page=Biological%20Sciences&pid=42&id=43">
          Dr. Vinita Gowda</a>.
          I graduated with an integrated Masters degree from IISER Trivandrum
          with a Major in Biology and a Minor in Chemistry. I worked with 
          <a href="http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculties/hsomanathan">Dr. Hema Somanathan</a> 
          for my Master's thesis project, on three sympatric carpenter bee species.
          </p>
          
          <p> In general I am very fascinated by interactions, how interspecific individuals 
          interact with each other, with other species. Its amazing that every interaction 
          that we come across has some uniqueness in itself. It is wonderful how plants, who 
          can't produce sound and move from place to place for interaction, can still interact 
          with other organisms and attract them to their own accord (of course it is not as 
          easy as it sounds). 
          </p>
          <p> As an intern, I have worked on diverse taxa during my undergraduate years.

          part of, refer to the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
