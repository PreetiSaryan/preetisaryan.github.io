          <p> I am graduate student at the 
          <a href="https://iiserb.ac.in/department.php?page=Biological%20Sciences&pid=42&id=43">
          Department of Biological Sciences, at IISER Bhopal</a>. I am currently working with 
          <a href="http://treelab.wixsite.com/tree"> Dr. Vinita Gowda</a>.
          I graduated with an integrated Masters degree from IISER Trivandrum
          with a Major in Biology and a Minor in Chemistry. I worked with 
          <a href="http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculties/hsomanathan">Dr. Hema Somanathan</a> 
          for my Master's thesis project, on temporal niche partitioning in three sympatric carpenter bee species.

          <p> In general, I'm fascinated by interactions. Its amazing that every interaction 
          that we come across has some uniqueness in itself. For my PhD, I'm working on the Ecology and Evolution of the genus
          <i>Hedychium </i>. I am interested in studing the evolutionary ramification of ecology and plant-pollinator interaction
          on species distribution, speciation and hybrid formation.
            
          </p>
          <p> I have worked on diverse taxa during my undergraduate years.
          For more on the work I've been 
          part of, refer to the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page. I am an amateur phtographer who likes to capture
          all that my lens can. You can visit my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aranyamloki/?hl=en"> Instagram profile </a>
