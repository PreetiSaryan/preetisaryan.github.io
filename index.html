                <p> I am graduate student at the Department of Biological Sciences, 
                at IISER Bhopal. I am currently working with 
                <a href="https://www.iiserbhopal.ac.in/profile.php?empid=MjAx&page=Biological%2520Sciences&pid=42&id=43">Dr. Vinita Gowda</a>.
                I graduated with an integrated Masters degree from IISER Trivandrum
                with a Major in Biology and a Minor in Chemistry. I worked with 
                <a href="">Dr. Hema Somanathan</a> for my Master's thesis project,
                on three sympatric carpenter bee species. As an intern, I have worked on diverse taxa during my undergraduate years.
             For more on the work I've been 
                part of, refer to the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
                
                <p>I also like to occassionally ramble, which you can 
                read about on <a href="blog.html">my blog</a>.
                My twitter handle is <code>@preetisaryan</code> and you can email
                me at <code><a href="mailto:preeti_s@iiserb.ac.in">preeti_s@iiserb.ac.in</a></code></p>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> If you feel deja-vu as you are going through 
                this website, as though you've seen this layout before, 
                it's because I lifted the layout straight out of
