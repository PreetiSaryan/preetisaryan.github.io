                <p>With <a href="http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculties/hsomanathan">Dr. Hema Somanathan</a>* 
                and <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~dbarua/">Dr. Deepak Barua</a>**, I monitored the phenology and 
                fruit infestation in <em> Catunaregam spinosa </em>. I also studied the pre-dispersal
                seed predator <em> Deudorix perse </em> to understand it's behaviour. The work was carried out at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimashankar_Wildlife_Sanctuary"> Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra, India </a>. A detailed report that 
                discusses the work can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                <p>I observed three sympatric carpenter bee species in their natural nesting habitat to study
                their temporal flight patterns, the niche overlap and abiotic factors affecting onset & offset of
                flight activity as a part of my Masters thesis under the supervision of Dr. Hema Somanathan. You can find my thesis

                <p>I synthesized Galactose based triazoles using click chemistry and assessed purity and
                structure of the compounds through NMR. These compounds were further studied for their
                medicinal properties by subjecting to HeLa cells. This project was part of my Minor project
                with Dr. K.M. Sureshan (School of Chemistry, IISER-TVM) as a part of Dual-BS-MS degree.

                <p>As part of a larger ongoing project on Myristica swamps, I was involved in characterizing the
                vegetation composition and structural features of Myristica swamps. I was part of developing
                the baseline information on the influence of habitat fragmentation on adult species richness
                and abundance in these swamp forests. I did this work in Dr. Hema Somanathan's lab as
                an intern.</p>

                <p>As an intern in the lab of Dr. Hema Somanathan, I looked at the multiple
                aspects of the reproductive ecology of <em>Baccaurea courtallensis</em>, this included determination of
                sex ratio, spatial dynamics using point pattern analysis and the effect of neighbouring trees
                on the fruit-set of females.

                <p>Along with Seshadri KS* and Dr. T. Ganesh* , I studied dietary composition, tropic niche width & overlap on the
                diets of arthropodivorous anurans, <em>Micrixalus fuscus</em> & <em>Nyctibatrachus cf. vasanthi</em>. Study
                involved bolus collection from live frogs in Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, Tamil Nadu
                and identification of insects in bolus.</p>
